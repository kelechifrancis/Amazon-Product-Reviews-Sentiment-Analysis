The product of interest is Amazon's Echo in it different colors and designs. The performance of each product variation is analyzed based on star ratings and sentiment of the review text. Oak Finish and Walnut Finish top the positivity percentage scale with a 100% positive review each.\n\nThree different ML models are trained to decipher the sentiment in a body of review text. Review texts were prepared for modelling by cleaning first- removing stop words and punctuation and then using NLP algorithms such as tokenization The models trained are; Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Classifier models with a 92%, 94% and 90% accuracy respectively.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing all relevant packages\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.069952Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.070401Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.076829Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.070367Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.075395Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"amazon_reviews = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/amazon-alexa-reviews/amazon_alexa.tsv', sep = '\\t')\namazon_reviews.head()\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.083630Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.084288Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.119879Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.084241Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.118797Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"amazon_reviews.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.122092Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.122706Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.141181Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.122666Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-01T12:55:50.140170Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the above, I can see that I am not missing any values on all five columns.
